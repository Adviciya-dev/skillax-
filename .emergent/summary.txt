**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - N/A

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Content Management:** The Admin CMS task is the primary refactoring effort to move hardcoded content to a manageable database system.
- **Lead Capture Integration:** The Course Quiz and AI Lab need to be refactored from being only in a FAB to being integrated as hooks and funnels throughout the site.

**key api endpoints**
- : Handles messages sent to the AI chatbot.
- : Submits a new lead.
- **Upcoming:**
  - : Endpoint to fetch visitor analytics.
  - , , , : Full CRUD for blog posts.
  - , : Endpoints to manage course content from the admin panel.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Highest Priority:** The user is insistent on getting the **Full Admin CMS** with statistics and blog management built. This should be the immediate focus.
- **Verify Before Proceeding:** Immediately after starting, take a screenshot of an individual course page () to verify the UI changes made at the end of the last session. The user has repeatedly pointed out the discrepancy between the main  page and the detail pages.
- **User's High Standards:** The user has an extremely high bar for UI/UX, demanding ultra-premium, wow factor designs with rich animations and floating elements. Do not consider a UI task complete until it meets this standard.
- **Hooks & Funnels:** Do not just place new features in one spot. The user wants lead-capture tools like the quiz and AI lab integrated strategically across the site to act as funnels.
